# Chainlink Agent Skills - Development Guide

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo of Chainlink agent skills. Each skill lives in its own top-level directory (e.g., `chainlink-ccip-skill/`, `chainlink-cre-skill/`, `chainlink-data-feeds-skill/`).

Each skill directory contains:
- `SKILL.md` - The skill definition with YAML frontmatter (name, description, version) and markdown instructions
- `references/` - Supporting reference docs the skill reads at runtime
- `agents/` (optional) - Platform-specific agent configs (e.g., `openai.yaml`)
- `assets/` (optional) - Supplementary assets like doc indexes

Evals live in `evals/<skill-name>/` with test cases, rubrics, and promptfoo configs.

## Versioning

Each skill tracks its own version in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter under `metadata.version` using semver (e.g., `"0.0.3"`).

**When you modify any file within a skill directory, bump that skill's patch version** (the `0.0.x` component) in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter. Only bump the skill that was actually changed. Do not bump versions for other skills that were not touched.

## Skill Format

Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). The `SKILL.md` frontmatter must include:
- `name` - Skill identifier (matches directory name)
- `description` - Trigger description used by agents to decide when to activate the skill
- `license`
- `compatibility`
- `allowed-tools`
- `metadata.version` - Semver string

## Running Evals

Each skill has an eval suite in `evals/<skill-name>/` containing test cases, grading rubrics, and a promptfoo config. Evals are organized into tiers:

| Tier | Cases | Method | When to use |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Smoke | ~20 | Agent-powered or promptfoo | Quick feedback during development |
| Full | All 95 | Promptfoo | Before releases, after major refactors |

Cases included in the smoke tier are tagged with `smoke: true` in their `metadata` block in the promptfoo configs.

### Agent-powered (no API keys needed)

Read and follow the protocol in `evals/run-agent-eval.md`. This runs generation and grading entirely through Cursor subagents. Smoke tier is the default:

```
Run agent evals for chainlink-ccip-skill
Run agent evals for chainlink-ccip-skill, full suite
Run agent evals for chainlink-data-feeds-skill, functional cases only
```

For baseline-vs-skill comparisons, read and follow `evals/run-agent-ab-test.md`. This is the preferred no-API path when the goal is to prove whether a skill improves answers, identify regressions, or drive an improvement loop:

```
Run an agent A/B test for chainlink-cre-skill using mixed-chainlink
Run an agent A/B test for chainlink-cre-skill using mixed-chainlink, then propose improvements
Run an agent A/B test for chainlink-ccip-skill, smoke tier
```

The agent A/B protocol creates isolated baseline, skill-enabled, evaluator, and aggregator subagents. It writes generated artifacts under `evals/runs/<skill>/<tag>/`; those run artifacts are for local review and should not be committed unless explicitly requested.

### With API keys (promptfoo)

If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set in `.env`:

```
source .env
cd evals/<skill-name>
npx promptfoo eval --filter-metadata "smoke=true"   # smoke tier
npx promptfoo eval                                    # full suite
npx promptfoo view
```

### When to run evals

- **Smoke**: After any change to a skill's `SKILL.md` or `references/`, before bumping patch version, when adding new eval cases
- **Full**: Before releases, after major refactors, or when smoke passes but you want full confidence

### Autonomous improvement (autoimprove)

Read and follow the protocol in `evals/improve-skill.md`. This runs an autonomous loop that iterates on a skill's instructions and references, using eval scores as the objective. The agent modifies the skill, runs smoke evals, keeps improvements, reverts regressions, and loops until stopped. Ask:

```
Improve chainlink-ccip-skill
Improve chainlink-data-feeds-skill, tag apr21
```

Requires either API keys in `.env` (for promptfoo-based evals) or sufficient subagent budget (for agent-powered evals). Promptfoo is fastest when API keys are available; agent A/B is preferred when avoiding external model API usage.

## Conventions

- Do not commit `.env` or secret files.
- Reference docs in `references/` should be kept factual and up to date with the latest Chainlink documentation.
- Eval cases go in `evals/<skill-name>/cases/` organized by category (`functional/`, `trigger-positive/`, `trigger-negative/`).
